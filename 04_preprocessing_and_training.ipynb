    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**A: 1 Further adding to our assessments in the exploratory data analysis stages, we start with a 70/30 Train/Test split to evaluate the performance of our model. This involves splitting our dataset into two subsets: one for training the model and the other for training its performance. Initially, we then compare our predicted mean to a benchmark generated by a dummy regressor, which yields the exact same results of $ 63.81 price point. We then used R2 (Coefficient of Determination), Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error as regression analysis metrics to assess how good one set of values agree with another. Using the average value as the prediction, a value of R2 = 0 has a baseline model that predicts the mean, whereas R2 = 1 indicates no residual error from a model that perfectly predicts the observed values. Models that do worse than predicting the mean will have increased sum of squares and would produce a negative R2. Additionally, the Mean Absolute Error measures the average absolute difference between the actual values and the predicted values produced by the model where in our test generated a $ 19.14 difference based on average known values. Comparatively, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a metric used to quantify the average squared difference between the actual values and the predicted values. When we root the MSE, low values means that, on average, the difference between the predicted values and the actual values is small. From our model, we can tell that the typical difference between our model’s prediction and the actual price is about $ 24. \n",
    "\n",
    "After imputing both train and test splits, our simple linear regression model explains over 80 % of the variance on the train set and over 70% on the test set. Using this model further, the mean absolute error expects a ticket price difference of +/- $9 from the real price. Further the Mean Squared Error are 111.90 and 161.73 on train set and test set respectively. Suspecting that the model was overfitting, SelectKbest along with f regression was used to determine the k best features. Cross validation partitions the dataset into subsets multiple times, where the primary goal is to assess how well the model generalizes unseen data. Using cross validation, it was found that a good value for k was 8 and resulted the most important 8 features along with their coefficients, where the results suggest that vertical drop is the biggest positive feature followed by Snow Making_ac. Comparatively, the skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price suggesting people would pay less for a larger resort. A Random Forest Regressor was then tried, and found that imputing with the median improves performance, but scaling features doesn't. Further from a barplot, it was found that the dominant top four features are in common with our linear model. \n",
    "\n",
    "To select for the best optimal model, the linear model and the random forest model were compared via cross validation by Mean Absolute Error. The Random Forest Model had a lower cross validation of 9.48 compared to the linear regression model of 11.79. Thus, the Random Forest Model had a lower cross-validation by almost $1 and therefore this is the model to proceed with.\n"
